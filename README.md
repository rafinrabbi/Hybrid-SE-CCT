# Hybrid-SE-CCT
This project implements a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) model for image classification tasks. The CCT model combines the strengths of convolutional layers and transformers, leveraging convolutional tokenizers and transformer encoders to achieve efficient and robust feature extraction and classification.
