# Hybrid-SE-CCT
This project implements a Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) model with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for enhanced image classification. The CCT model combines convolutional layers and transformers to effectively capture local and global features, while SE blocks enhance feature recalibration. The repository includes a TensorFlow-based data pipeline with image loading, augmentation, and batching, enabling efficient model training and evaluation on custom datasets with robust data handling and augmentation techniques.
